# üéì CS-673 Project (Intro to Deep Generative Models)

## üìú Overview

The task of **Causal Discovery** is to uncover the true DAG \(G\) given a dataset \(D\) such that \(pD ‚àº G\). Since the work of [ZARX18], which transformed the task of causal discovery to a continuous optimization program with acyclicity constraints, significant attention has shifted to deep learning-based causal discovery algorithms.

In this project, we select **DECI (Deep End-to-end Causal Inference)**, a SOTA causal discovery algorithm for iid observational data by [GAF+22], a variational inference model modeling exogenous noise as a normalizing flow.

Since the literature on causal discovery algorithms for time-series data using deep learning techniques is quite limited and virginal, we opt to implement DECI on time-series data using lagged cross-sectional data. Finally, we evaluate our performance against non-deep-learning-inspired algorithms (PCMCI, PCMCI(+) etc.) on time-series synthetic data with known ground truth causal graph [LKSS20].

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

There are two separate environments that need to be configured to reproduce this project: **CDML** and **DECI (causica)**.

### üêç Creating Virtual Environments

You may create the virtual environments with their respective requirements using the provided `.yml` files, using for example your Anaconda installation, on your shell as

1. For CDML:
   ```conda env create -f environment_cdml.yml
   ```

2. For causica:
   ```conda env create -f environment_causica.yml
   ```

### üìå Environment Details

- The first environment runs on Python 3.8.19.
- The second environment runs on Python 3.10.1.
